# PikaRAG — Status

Point Claude at this file after `/clear` to pick up where things left off.
This is a snapshot, not a source of truth — always re-verify against the repo
(`git log`, `git status`, `pytest -q`) rather than trusting this blindly if
it's been a while.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-12, at commit `53c1a3f` (main). Bot deployed and
confirmed live in Discord this session (see `RESUME.md`); a project cleanup
+ code-review pass landed 5 more commits after that (README/`.gitignore`
polish, a new spend-tracking feature for `/ask`, five real bug fixes in
`/calc`, a team-import parsing fix, and a damage-formula correctness fix,
verified against Bulbapedia); the server was then updated to match (`git
pull` + restart, confirmed healthy). 262/262 tests passing.
<!-- STATUS_COMMIT: 53c1a3f -->
<!-- This HTML comment is machine-read by a Stop hook (.claude/settings.json)
     that nags to refresh this file whenever HEAD moves past this hash.

If `RESUME.md` says anything other than "nothing in progress," read it first —
it holds exact in-flight state from a session that paused mid-task (token
budget or compaction), which is more specific than this snapshot.

## Where things stand

All planned code work is done and merged to `main`. 262/262 tests passing.
Data is current for **Regulation M-C** (315 -> 345 legal Pokemon, live since
2026-09-08) -- see the `data:`/`fix:`/`feat:` commits from 2026-09-10.
`vgc_items.json` (197 items, now complete against everything `damage_calc`
supports) is wired into `/ask` (RAG) and validated in `/calc`/`/scout`/`/import`.

- **Data pipeline** (`pipeline/`) — PokéAPI + Pikalytics fetch, merge into
  `data/processed/pokemon_records.json` + `pikalytics_usage.json`
- **Damage calculator** (`damage_calc/`) — ported `@smogon/calc` logic
- **RAG core** (`rag/`) — embed, store, retrieve, Haiku-backed `/ask`
- **Bot commands** (`bot/commands/`, wired in `bot/main.py`) — `/ping`,
  `/ask`, `/stats`, `/moves`, `/calc`, `/import`, `/scout`, `/team`
  (Pokepaste team memory, feeds stored teams into `/calc` and `/ask`)
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs pytest
- **Deploy scaffolding** — systemd units + timers + Oracle Cloud runbook in
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `deploy/`

Full checklist with what's resolved vs. open: `pika-rag-project-plan.md`
("Build Order" and "Open Items" sections).

## What's actually left

Deployment is fully done as of 2026-09-12 — bot is live, `/ping` confirmed
working in Discord, and the server is caught up to `main` (`git pull` +
restart done after the cleanup/bug-hunt commits landed). Full detail in
`RESUME.md`.

1. ~~Get a Discord bot token + invite it to a server~~ done
2. ~~Get an Anthropic API key and set a spend cap~~ done ($5 cap, both
   secrets in local `.env`; server's `.env` currently relies on
   `ANTHROPIC_SPEND_CAP_USD`'s `5.0` default rather than setting it
   explicitly -- fine, just worth tidying up eventually)
3. ~~Provision the Oracle Cloud free-tier ARM instance~~ done — recreated
   2026-09-11 (`project-pikarag`, public IP `193.122.155.20`) after the
   first attempt's private-subnet misconfig
4. ~~Server setup: clone repo, venv, `.env`, run both refresh jobs~~ done
5. ~~Install systemd units, verify the bot responds in Discord~~ done —
   `/ping` confirmed working live in Discord on 2026-09-12

Everything below is optional follow-up, none of it blocking:

- **Known limitation (not fixable from this repo):** Pikalytics hasn't
  published a ranked-ladder format code for Regulation M-C yet, so
  `PIKALYTICS_FORMAT_CODE` (`pipeline/fetch_pikalytics.py`) still points at
  M-B's code as a stand-in. Two species new to M-C (Farfetch'd, Sirfetch'd)
  have no usage data as a result -- everything else works normally. Re-check
  once Pikalytics' M-C ladder has accumulated enough data to publish a
  format code, update the constant, then re-run `refresh_pikalytics_job`.
  (Documented in `README.md`'s Status section too.)
- The ToS/Privacy Policy Claude Artifact
  (`https://claude.ai/code/artifact/c8af5a8a-f5ad-420c-8dfe-9d260f6d0ea7`)
  is still private -- only matters if the bot is ever submitted somewhere
  that verifies those URLs (e.g. Discord's public bot verification).
- Confirm Pikalytics scraping is within their ToS (pipeline has been
  running against it, never formally checked).
- `deploy/cloud-init.sh` has a real bug (see memory
  `pikarag-oracle-networking-gotchas`): `useradd -m` populates `/opt/pikarag`
  with skeleton dotfiles before `git clone` runs into it, which fails since
  the directory isn't empty. Only matters on the next from-scratch instance
  recreation -- doesn't affect the currently-running instance.

## Useful pointers

- `pika-rag-project-plan.md` — architecture, scope, build-order checklist
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — step-by-step deploy runbook (start here for next work)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/` — design docs and
  implementation plans for each shipped feature (data pipeline + damage calc,
  Pikalytics usage data, Pokepaste team memory)

## How to re-orient fast

```bash
git log --oneline -10        # what shipped most recently
git status                   # anything in flight
pytest -q                    # confirm the suite still passes
```
